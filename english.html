    <h1>Modern Day Comparison</h1>
    <p>In The Great Gatsby, Scott Fitzgerald uses the Wilson and the Buchanan family to show the financial struggle of lower-class families versus families who are already well-established and therefore have much greater opportunities. This is still true for our society today where people who are already well-established have more privilege than people from lower-income families.</p>
     <div class="newhehe">
    <button onclick="document.location='new.html'" id="browseBtn">1st Argument>></button>
  </div>
    <p>An example of the rich people earning a greater chance to achieve what they want is when Tom takes Nick off the train to meet his mistress Myrtle (between the East Egg and New York). After that, Tom talks about Mr. Wilson while thinking he is a God and criticizes Mr. Wilson's stupidity when “he thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive” (Fitzgerald 26). While Tom had access to all those luxurious things when he was firstborn, Mr. WIlson who comes from the lower class doesn’t earn those privileges. Tom judges Mr. WIlson for not knowing what is going on as he is lacking education but Mr. Wilson doesn’t earn a chance to have an education like Tom did which would impact his entire life. </p>
     <p>While Tom with his well-established can control people with his money and live off his assets, Wilson has to work hard just to survive. His lack of education causes him to have a financial struggle and impacts his family relationship as he doesn’t have money to afford things his wife wants. Education for lower class incomes still becomes a major problem in today's world as teenagers have to work extra hours to afford their meals which causes them to have a difficult time keeping up with their schoolwork. This ends up like a cycle for the next generation and they can’t escape it unless they are extremely smart.</p>
        <div class="newhaha">
    <button onclick="document.location='new.html'" id="browseBtn">2nd Argument>></button>
  </div>
    <p>Another example that low-income households don't have the opportunity to reach success is shown when Erika Giovanetti, a personal finance reporter for Fox Business, tells other people that “About two in five (42%) college dropouts cite financial reasons for leaving school, outweighing the percentage of students who left for other reasons like family commitments (32%) and health reasons (15%).” This evidence shows that money is one of the major reasons why students dropout of college.
</p>
        <p>Dropping out of college causes the reputation of poverty for the next generation as teenagers have to prioritize money to buy their meals and survive for their families rather than education. People want to escape their poor families as they are trying to study to earn a high-income job but now the only gate to escape is getting blocked by the reality of survival. Poverty also appears in Mr. WIlson's family as he tries hard in his auto mechanic business but he still earns a low income as he doesn’t have the opportunity to have an education and get ahead in society.
</p>
      <div class="newImg">
    <button onclick="document.location='new.html'" id="browseBtn">3rd Argument>></button>
  </div>
    <p>Another example of how rich people have more privilege than the poor is Jeffrey Epstein who was accused of running a "vast network" of underage girls for sex. He bribed the policemen with his money and he was never caught until later on, he got investigated by the FBI. In the end, he has an injury to his neck so he passed away but it seems hard to believe that he has never experienced one day in prison despite his terrifying crime. </p>
        <p>Even though in front of the law, everyone should be treated equally but now he uses his money to hide his crime from the public and be above the law. He uses his money and status to buy all his gates out of prison for almost twenty years and let thirty-six victims suffer from mental and physical health while he lives his best life with all the luxurious things. </p>
          <p>He looks like a careless person who let others clean up his mess, just as it happens in the book with Daisy Buchanan who hits and runs but lets Gatsby take the blame for her. Daisy also becomes a buyer of alcoholic drinks which was banned at the time but she doesn’t seem to care as she knows her money will buy her gate out of prison. If Epstein and Daisy are poor, they will never have a chance to bribe law enforcement and always be charged with whatever crime they did.</p>
       <p>The money of some well-established people eases their access to everything they want whether it is education, material things, or even if they commit something illegal. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald conveys how the Wilson family, a low-income household, still finds it difficult to get ahead as they don’t have many opportunities to achieve success compared to others.</p>
