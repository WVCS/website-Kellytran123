    <h1>Women’s Rights: A Positive and Lasting Legacy</h1>
    <p>The women’s rights movement has positively changed American society by enhancing equal rights for wages and giving women control of their bodies with access to abortion.</p>

  </div>
    <p>Proving to be a major step toward gender equality, President John F. Kennedy passed the Equal Pay Act, which enforced equality amongst women under the law. After a long time of protesting for equal rights about wages, there is finally an act called the Equal Pay Act which gives “equal pay for equal work. If a woman could do the same work that a man could perform, as women had shown themselves capable of doing during the wars” (Green and Rogers). The Equal Pay Act banned sex discrimination in wages where women and men receive equal pay in the same workplace if they produce the same work as others. </p>
    <p> Providing equal pay to women would have a dramatic impact on their families. Women now can have the same voice as men in their family as she is now able to be financially independent. She can step out of an abusive relationship if she wants to as now she can feed herself. As women can earn a higher wage, their families are having a higher chance to get out of poverty. According to the graph When Men Earn More: The Startling Truth Behind the Pay Group - and What Women Can Do About It, by Christina Fisanick, an associate professor of English, there are several jobs where women can earn more money such as biological technicians, sales engineers, or statisticians (Christina). </p>
     <p>After the Equal Pay Act, women are now having a bigger impact on the workplace and for some jobs, they can even earn more money than men. This statistic shows if women try their best and work hard in their job, they can still have an opportunity to earn more money than men. Giving them more wages can give them higher motivation to work more and affirm their self-worth. It gives women more confidence in their families and gives them a way to escape the traditional lifestyle - becoming a housewife. In conclusion, giving a law that requires equal pay for men and women helps the economy and encourages more women to enter the workforce.</p>

  </div>
    <p>Roe V. Wade benefits women as it protects a person’s right to make their own private medical decisions. Senator Obama showed his point of view on Roe V. Wade as he believed that women know the best for their own health and for the kids, “But what ultimately [he] believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.” (Obama, “Remarks” 255) Senator Obama believed that the choice of having an abortion should become a women’s choice and not the government’s choice to tell what to do based on the First Amendment. Senator Obama stated his belief that women should be free to alter their bodies however they see fit. 
</p>
        <p>Frequently, the desire to keep women from making decisions in the areas of politics, business, society, and culture coexist with the opposition to giving them power over their own bodies. Unwanted pregnancies had a negative impact on a woman's physical and mental health. It is obvious that one's decisions about their body, particularly their capacity for reproduction, fall under the category of private choice. The decision of a pregnant woman should not be influenced by the government because only she can decide whether she is ready to become a mother. Based on a New York Times newspaper, Roe v. Wade case has a positive effect on women as “After Roe v. Wade, state and federal funding for abortions became a critical question in the abortion rights debate. Legalization of abortion helped to lower the price of abortions; black market rates ran as high as $1,000 before legalization.” (Lerner, 205) 
</p>
    <p> Legalized abortion helped women, especially poor women if they wanted to get rid of an unwanted baby. Women are better able to maintain a more enjoyable attitude toward the future and carry out their aspirational life plans when they are given the opportunity to have the abortion they desire. An unwanted baby becomes an obstacle for a woman to achieve their personal goals and it is just unfair for them to be born when they are not ready. Forcing a woman to give birth to a baby will only make them emotionally abusive and this harms their incoming baby. Society can not punish a woman to commit a life-long commitment because she (or her partner) forgot to take pregnancy prevention. </p>

    <p>Even though there is a laws to improve women’s life such as the Equal Pay Act or legalizing abortion rights, nowadays, women still struggle to earn the same wages as men and have access to abortion. Michele Gilman, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law in Baltimore, gives people a fact about abortion which said that “it has been so since the 1976 enactment of the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal Medicaid funds from being used for abortions except in cases of rape or incest or when the life of the mother is at risk.” (Gilman) </p>
        <p>The government discourages abortion by no longer paying cases unless the mother was at risk of losing her life if she chose to keep the child, the baby was the victim of rape or incest or both. Poor women get affected the most after this decision because they don’t get the money to have abortions. Women who are refused access to abortions are more likely to experience poverty, and unemployment, and to rely on public assistance. They were being pushed to bear a child even if they were not ready. Poor women can barely feed themselves and now with a new baby, it will make her situation even worse as she (and her husband) have to raise one more person. </p>
          <p>Even though with an Equal Pay Act, there is still discrimination based on race as a statistic from Institute for Women's Policy Research, showed that “Women earn less than men (these calculations include full-time workers only) in each of these most common occupations for women; the gender wage gap is largest for 'retail salesperson,' with a gender median earnings ratio for full-time work of 64.3 percent.” (Hegewisch and Matite) When comparing the median weekly earnings for their most common occupations, women earned less than men did. Equal pay for women was encouraged because they needed to be independent of their husbands. </p>
       <p>However, there is occupational and industrial segregation, where women are overrepresented in some occupations and sectors and underrepresented in others, which results in lower pay for women and adds to the overall gender wage gap. Low compensation for women lowers their motivation to work harder which also contributes to long-term economic hardship. In conclusion, there is still a need for improvement in women’s rights and to produce new laws to create new opportunities to let them achieve their personal goals. </p>
